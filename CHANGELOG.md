# Changelog

All notable changes to this project are recorded here. Versions follow `MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH[.HOTFIX]` and tags live on the public repository (`giljoai/GiljoAI_MCP`).

## [Unreleased] — v1.3 groundwork

### BREAKING CHANGE — minimum Python raised to 3.12

Bumped `requires-python` in `pyproject.toml` from `>=3.10` to `>=3.12`. Removed `Programming Language :: Python :: 3.10` and `:: 3.11` PyPI classifiers.

`pip install` on pre-3.12 Python now fails with a `requires-python` resolver error. CI, installer scripts (`install.py`, `install.ps1`, `install.sh`), and docs already required 3.12; this aligns the wheel-build constraint with the de-facto minimum already enforced everywhere else.

## [1.2.3] — 2026-05-03

Sprint v1.2.3 release: one security fix and a refactor of the skills-version drift banner that turned three pieces of state into one.

### SEC-5009 — remove `GiljoMCP` password fallback

`UserService.create_user` no longer silently substitutes the literal `"GiljoMCP"` when no password is supplied. The admin endpoint now forwards `user_data.password` and the service treats the absence of a password as an explicit error. Reviewer + tester clean (zero findings, 64/64 unit + 985/985 service tests). Stale `GiljoMCP` tenant_key matrix verified false on dev / demo prod / dogfood — no rotation needed.

### IMP-5024 — skills-version drift banner: simplified server-side model

Replaces the per-user tracking model from HO1028 + IMP-0022. The previous design used three pieces of state (`users.last_installed_skills_version` column + `localStorage giljo_skills_version` cache + server-side `never_installed` flag) for what is fundamentally one comparison: "did the bundled `SKILLS_VERSION` move past the version we last announced?"

- **New migration `ce_0009`** drops `users.last_installed_skills_version` and `users.last_update_reminder_at`, then seeds `system_settings.skills_version_announced` to the current bundled `SKILLS_VERSION` via `ON CONFLICT DO NOTHING`.
- **Endpoint `/api/notifications/check-skills-version`** now returns `{current, announced, drift_detected, message}` — no per-user state involved. Drift is the difference between what the running deployment ships with and what was last operator-announced.
- **`SystemStatusBanner.vue`** simplified: `showSkillsDrift = isAdmin && drift_detected && !dismissedForCurrent`. Per-version dismissal continues via `localStorage.giljo_skills_dismissed_for_<version>`. Banner switched from `type="info"` (Vuetify blue) to `type="warning"` (brand yellow `#ffc300`) for better contrast and semantic correctness — drift is a "take action" notice.
- **30-day post-login reminder loop dropped.** Per-version dismissal is the right primitive; the throttle was belt-and-suspenders.
- Edition-aware copy: CE says "run `/giljo_setup` then `git pull`"; demo/saas says just "run `/giljo_setup`" (no `git pull` line — those users don't run the server).

Verified on dogfood: bumped `SKILLS_VERSION` triggers banner, click-X dismisses it, F5 reload keeps it dismissed (per-version key), bumping again re-arms.

## [1.2.2] — 2026-05-01

Foundation + installer hardening release. Two substantial pieces of work that set up the next several sprints: a real single-source-of-truth for project status, and a cross-platform installer story that finally works end-to-end on every supported path.

### Project status SSoT (BE-5039)

- **`ProjectStatus` is now a typed enum.** Eight statuses (`active`, `inactive`, `staging`, `paused`, `completed`, `cancelled`, `terminated`, `archived`) live in one place — no more drift between backend services, frontend stores, and database CHECK constraints.
- **New REST endpoint `GET /api/v1/project-statuses/`** exposes the canonical list with labels, color tokens, and lifecycle flags. Frontend reads from this, never from a hardcoded array.
- **Migration `ce_0008`** converts the existing TEXT column to a Postgres enum type with idempotent guards: NULL backfill before cast, unknown-value catch-all, partial unique index drop-and-recreate against the enum value. Safe to re-run.
- **Backwards compatible.** `ProjectStatus` inherits from `str`, so every existing `project.status == "active"` comparison still works. Callers adopt the enum at their own pace.
- **Adding a new status is now a one-record change.** `PROJECT_STATUS_META` centralizes label, color, immutability, and MCP-mutability per status.

### Installer hardening (INF-5014)

All four install paths now work on stock systems with no manual prep:

- **Windows `install.ps1`** — verified on stock PowerShell 5.1 + Windows 11.
- **Windows `install.py` direct** — Node.js auto-installs via `winget` when missing; PATH refresh resolves the chicken-egg where a subprocess inherits the pre-install PATH.
- **Linux `install.sh`** — verified on stock Ubuntu / Debian / WSL.
- **Linux `install.py` direct** — `python3-venv` detection now uses an actual `ensurepip` probe instead of `venv --help` (which doesn't fail when the module is missing). Catches the broken split-package state on stock Debian/Ubuntu before it becomes a cryptic error mid-install.

The "please restart your shell" banner now only fires on Windows where it's actually needed. Eight commits of fixes; every fix verified on a real box.

**macOS is not validated this release.** The CI smoke matrix runs `install.py` on macOS-latest, but no end-to-end real-box test was performed. Track as a known gap.

### Tooling

- **New `scripts/check_version_consistency.py`** — `VERSION` is the single source of truth; `pyproject.toml`, `frontend/package.json`, `package-lock.json`, `__init__.py` fallback, and the latest `CHANGELOG.md` entry must all match. Wired into pre-commit and the release pipeline. Bump everything atomically with `python scripts/check_version_consistency.py --bump X.Y.Z`. Catches the drift class that nearly slipped this release out the door with a stale `package-lock.json`.

### Notes for upgraders

- No database schema rollback path. `ce_0008` is a one-way migration; if you need to back out, restore from a pre-upgrade backup.
- Routine `git pull` + restart on the test/dogfood server. `startup.py` runs `alembic upgrade head` automatically.

## [1.2.1] — 2026-04-30

- **BREAKING:** `list_projects` MCP tool no longer returns completed or cancelled projects by default. Pass `include_completed=true` to retrieve archived projects. Agents running `list_projects()` with no arguments will now see only active/inactive projects.
- **New filter parameters:** `status` (single or comma-separated), `project_type`, `taxonomy_alias_prefix`, `created_after`, `created_before`, `completed_after`, `completed_before`, `include_completed`, `hidden` (tri-state: `"true"` / `"false"` / `""` for no filter).
- **`hidden` field behaviour:** The `hidden` column is a UI declutter flag and appears in every row regardless of filter. Agents always see hidden and non-hidden projects alike unless `hidden=true|false` is passed explicitly. It is not an agent-visibility gate.
- **Legacy backward-compat:** Callers using `status_filter="all"` continue to work; that value implies `include_completed=True` and is honored when the new `status` param is unset.
- **REST endpoint unchanged:** `GET /api/projects/` (used by the dashboard) was not modified — only the MCP-tool-facing path changed.

## [1.2.0] — 2026-04-29

The first minor-version release since the v1.1 line, consolidating six weeks of installer hardening, dependency cleanup, and dashboard polish into a single public cut. If you've been running v1.1.9.5, this upgrade is recommended — especially on Windows.

### Installers, fixed for real

- **Windows install now works on stock PowerShell 5.1.** Earlier Windows installs could fail with cryptic parser errors before reaching the wizard; `install.ps1` is now ASCII-clean and parses correctly under every PowerShell version that ships with Windows 10 / 11.
- **macOS Apple Silicon installs are more resilient.** A new floor on the `greenlet` dependency plus an explicit fail-fast guard prevents the long silent hangs that some early Apple Silicon users saw when binary wheels weren't yet published for a new Python release.
- **Linux first-run no longer crashes** on the elevation-guidance step. A path edge case that produced `ValueError` on stock Ubuntu has been fixed.

### Dashboard polish

- **"Tools → Connect"** replaces the old "Settings → Integrations" naming throughout the dashboard. Same feature, clearer mental model: one place to connect Claude Code, Cursor, and other tooling.
- **Welcome wizard** now offers a starter-template card on step 4 so new users can get to a working agent setup with a single click.

### Agent skills bundle (v1.1.11)

- **`/gil_add` gained a Read mode**, so you can pull a project's context or status by alias without opening the dashboard. Add mode is unchanged.
- **Faster, cheaper agent context fetches.** Agents now fetch only the context they need rather than pulling the full bundle every time — meaningfully fewer tokens per multi-step run.
- **Cleaner predecessor handling.** Multi-agent handovers now auto-detect whether you're handing off or being handed to, removing a class of "wrong context" agent runs.
- The dashboard will show a "skills bundle out of date" banner when you load v1.2.0 for the first time — that's expected. Run `giljo_setup` (or pull the latest skills via the dashboard) to upgrade your local CLI skills to v1.1.11.

### Under the hood

- Frontend toolchain is back on a stable, broadly-tested vite line. Vite 8 was briefly trialed but pulled back when its new bundler stack proved unstable on macOS and Windows under real installer conditions; the upgrade will return once that stack ships a stable 1.0.
- Frontend builds now require Node 22 (matching what most current distributions ship by default).
- Updated dependencies: `vue`, `postcss`, `greenlet` — all routine patch / minor bumps.
- Repository housekeeping: legacy distribution-tarball scripts removed (the hosted installer at `giljo.ai/install.ps1` and `giljo.ai/install.sh` is the only supported install path). Security policy document rewritten to accurately reflect current supported versions.

### Notes for upgraders

- Tagged as `v1.2.0-rc.1` first; promoted to `v1.2.0` after a soak window.
- No database schema changes vs v1.1.9.5. Routine `git pull` + restart is sufficient.
- If you're upgrading from v1.1.9.4 or earlier, you'll also pick up the security-foundation work that landed in v1.1.9.5 (four-layer secrets defense, hardened CI). No action required on your end.

## [1.1.9.5] — 2026-04-29

Security foundation release. Public repo brought from "no protections" to a full four-layer secrets defense in one session.

- Three-layer secrets defense established (gitignore + pre-commit `gitleaks` + push-CI `gitleaks` on private; defensive working-tree `gitleaks` on public)
- Boundary `gitleaks` gate added to `export_ce.sh` and `export_ce_dev.sh` (INF-5018) — last-chance scan after SaaS-strip and before push to public
- Private repo migrated to PRIMARY CI gate with branch-protection ruleset (9 required checks); public CI slimmed to a 6-check smoke set (INF-5017)
- Cross-platform installer smoke matrix (Ubuntu / Windows / macOS) added to private CI (INF-5016) — caught a real macOS arm64 `greenlet` regression on first run
- History rewrite: stripped HAR files (containing PII) from both repos including 16 version tags
- Bulk cleanup: 19 stale branches deleted per repo (Dependabot + abandoned dev branches)

## [1.1.9.4] — 2026-04-28

- Frontend deps train: `cryptography` 47, `numpy` 2.2.6 (with `sumy` LSA verified), `vite` 8 *(reverted in [Unreleased] — see above)*
- Linux installer fix: `Path.relative_to` `ValueError` in `display_elevation_guide`
